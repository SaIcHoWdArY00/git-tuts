 Hello, I'm Saipradeep. I'm a seasoned software developer with a strong background in Identity and Access Management (IAM) specifically SailPoint IdentityIQ. //I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my expertise to the IAM team at Penn State.

First of all Thank you for considering my application. and Let me delve into my journey and expertise in detail:

I began my career with deep understanding and experience in Java web application development, along with Identity and access management, where I insatlled and configured WebSphere application server and worked on OOTB connectors and onboarded applications like SAP, Salesforce, PeopleSoft and modified the incoming Identity data using custom rules. Along with the above applications I worked on AD. also Developed custom workflows and forms to manage the identity life-cycle using beanshell scripting.  I played an important role in implementing and managing SailPoint IdentityIQ solutions. One of my significant achievements was being part of the team responsible for the successful upgrade from SailPoint IdentityIQ version 7.3p3 to 8.0. This involved meticulous planning, testing, and execution to ensure a smooth transition and optimize the platform's capabilities for enhanced identity governance.


Coming to my most recent role at NewronTech, I continued to expand my expertise in SailPoint IdentityIQ. where I led the onboarding of client-specific applications like Active Directory, WorkDay, ServiceNow and worked on various OOTB connectors like Delimited, JDBC, LDAP, and I've leveraged popular web services protocols like SCIM and REST to integrate various applications and systems with SailPoint IdentityIQ. I developed custom buildMap and creation rules using Java Beanshell scripting to manage Identites and their access for seamless integation.  I Additionally implemented UI branding to align with organizational standards, and I configured various self-service features in SailPoint, such as password management and forgot password change functionalities, empowering users to manage their own accounts and reducing the load on our IT helpdesk. I'm experienced with version control tools like Git and BitBucket, which I've used to manage codebase changes, facilitate collaboration, and ensure version consistency across projects. I've also worked with databases such as Oracle, MySQL, and MSSQL, leveraging them for seamless data integration and management within SailPoint IdentityIQ. 

I developed and maintained comprehensive documentation, ensuring clear communication and successful implementation of SailPoint solutions. One of my key areas of expertise is in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and managing access requests within SailPoint IdentityIQ. I've designed and implemented RBAC frameworks, developed processes for requesting, approving, and granting access to various systems, and ensured secure and efficient user access management. I worked on custom workflows to manage the life-cycles of the employees and contractors. custom forms for Access provisioning and de-provisioning. Alongside I also have experience in Certifications and life-cycle events of certifications. 

Alongside my technical skills, I possess excellent oral and written communication skills, allowing me to effectively collaborate with business units, communicate with leaders and IT staff, and mentor less-experienced team members. My problem-solving abilities, attention to detail, and enthusiasm for learning new skills and technologies have been instrumental in my successful project deliveries and professional growth.

I hold a Master's degree in computer science, and my professional interests extend to areas like Identity and Access Management, third-party access solution selection and implementation. 

I'm eager to leverage my comprehensive skill set in SailPoint IdentityIQ, and Java development to contribute meaningfully to Penn State's IAM team, collaborate with various business units to design and implement integrations using web services protocols, version control, and databases, and help drive the success of the identity governance system.
