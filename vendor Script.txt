This early accomplishment laid the groundwork for my subsequent specialization in identity and access management (IAM).

In the IAM sphere, I set up Oracle Identity Manager Suite components from scratch within a Linux virtual machine environment, including installation, configuration, and testing to ensure a reliable and secure identity management solution. I deployed the AD Connector within Oracle Identity Manager (OIM) to automate the provisioning and de-provisioning of users, streamlining administrative tasks and improving operational efficiency. My responsibilities expanded to managing user provisioning and de-provisioning across multiple endpoint servers such as Active Directory, RACF, and LDAP using Identity Manager, ensuring efficient user lifecycle management.

Simultaneously, I refined my database design skills, focusing on Oracle Database and advancing my proficiency in PL/SQL. I implemented SSO authentication using JSP and integrated it with database security tables. I managed login authentication and authorization using SiteMinder, creating rules, policies, and response groups. Additionally, I mapped SQL databases and objects in Java using iBATIS and installed and configured CA SiteMinder Federation User Authentication Services using SAML 2.0. I provided 24x7 support for SiteMinder, handling deployments, upgrades, and issue resolution during off-business hours.

My expertise further grew with SailPoint IdentityIQ, a leading identity governance platform, where I participated in a migration project from Oracle Identity Manager (OIM) to SailPoint IdentityIQ. I assisted senior team members in analyzing the existing OIM infrastructure and contributed to the development of a comprehensive migration strategy to SailPoint IdentityIQ. I supported the transfer of user identities, access privileges, and security policies from OIM to SailPoint IdentityIQ, ensuring no loss of data or functionality.
